First, please run this SQL command in your phpMyAdmin. This will add a unique key to the `product_stocks` table, which is necessary to ensure that there are no duplicate stock entries for the same product and size.

```sql
ALTER TABLE `product_stocks` ADD UNIQUE `product_id_size` (`product_id`, `size`);
```

After you have run this command, I will update the `api.php` file to correctly save the stock changes.
